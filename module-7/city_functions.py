# Creating a function to pass a City and Country as City,Country. Using title to force capitalization of each word
# Updated version now includes the 3rd parameter for population. I formated it so it uses a comma in the results
# Updated version to allow population to be option utilizing if/else statements
# Updated version to include language. To allow this to pass without assigning =None I have to put before population
def city_country(city, country, population=None, language=None):
    if population is None and language is None:
        return (f"{city.title()}, {country.title()}")
    elif population is None:
        return (f"{city.title()}, {country.title()}, {language.capitalize()}")
    elif language is None:
        return (f"{city.title()}, {country.title()} - population {int(population):,}")
    else:
        return (f"{city.title()}, {country.title()} - population {int(population):,}, {language.capitalize()}")


# Calling the city_country function 3 times using places I have family ties to
# Changed the text case to ensure .title capitalizes the first letter and lower case each other letter per each word
# Updated to verify the results pass with a population, with no population parameter entered or population=None
# Updated to include language and entered in different casing to confirm .capitalize formatting
print(city_country(city="albuquerque", country="UNITED States of America", population="500000", language="english"))
print(city_country(city="Palermo", country="sicily", language="ITALIAN"))
print(city_country(city="oslo", country="norway", population=None))
